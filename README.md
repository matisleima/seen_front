## description
This is the front end code of a prototype web app for sharing mushroom picking spots which is 
an absolutely unwanted and never occuring thing in the life of mushroom-loving
people of Estonia. These places have been family secrets for decades and this app
is here to shamefully break that tradition.

## instructions
The app features a map of Estonia, a text box and buttons for adding,
editing and deleting mushroom picking locations. 

### view locations
Hover on the pins with the cursor to read about the existing spots.
Zoom and drag the map for a more detailed navigation.

### add a new location
Simply click on the map, fill the text box with info about what can be found on spot and clik 'SALVESTA'.

### edit an existing location
Click on an existing pin, drag it to a new location and/or change its description. Finally click 'MUUDA'.

### delete a location
Click on an existing pin and 'KUSTUTA'.

### misc
Clicking on the backgrounds cancels all ongoing operations.

### P.S. 
There is a known and unsolved Leaflet-Vue bug that throws an error in some
map navigation combinations, most notably click on pin and zoom.

### NB!
NEVER share the whereabouts of a mushroom picking spot that you didn't discover yourself!
